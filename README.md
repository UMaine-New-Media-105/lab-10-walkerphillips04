https://editor.p5js.org/walker.phillips/sketches/Vi_DUjCqt: For this assingment I pulled a few things from a few different projects. I used my old face sprite for the main character and I an old keyPressed function from an older lab to control the sprite.  I created two roads with grass inbetween and made four different "logs" to go around.  I was planning on doing two streams with brown logs going down them but I later decided to make a road with cars instead. But I forgot to change the name, That is why they are still named "Log" I actually really enjoyed creating this game.
